{"name":"Kollektiv","tagline":"Supporting the next generation of developers.","body":"### Welcome to Kollektiv\r\nWe are a collective of female developers in Berlin. We build web applications to help solve internal company issues. While we build products for clients, we learn to code at the same time. Mentors help with client projects, clients get quality products, and the money supports the collective. Our vision is that every person who dreams of becoming a developer - regardless of education level, identit(ies) or background - should have a financially stable opportunity to pursue that dream. Kollektiv aims to build part of the infrastructure necessary to support this next generation of developers.\r\n\r\n### Our Story\r\nWe are Nina and Laura. Nina started her own company in Slovenia and Laura worked as a program manager with queer and transgender youth in the US. We both had the feeling that programming was too macho for us - that perhaps it was just for men - until we found Rails Girls. We both completed the Rails Girls Summer of Code, where we spent 3 months learning Ruby on Rails full-time. Five months ago we didn't know a thing about GitHub and today we're ready to work on real client projects. \r\n\r\nThere are plenty of people just like us who are making a switch to programming mid-career. We call them the \"next generation of developers\". The vision of Kollektiv is to support the next generation of developers by working with mentors on real projects (for real money). With a financially stable path for learning and a supportive community, we will contribute true diversity to the growing technology sector.\r\n\r\n### What We Do\r\nWe build Ruby on Rails web applications. Do you have something you've always wanted to build but don't have the time? Need an online store or an internal solution for your office? We can build it.\r\n\r\nWe use an agile approach to software development and value simple solutions. To stay agile, we work directly with your team to make sure that we build an MVP that works. Weekly updates help us stay in touch and GitHub helps us track our progress. \r\n\r\nOnce we agree on a project scope, we work alongside professional mentors in the field to help us deliver a great product. Mentors take the burden off of your company to supply a quality learning experience and we work to share learning infrastructure with the wider community. \r\n\r\nPayment is structured as a sponsorship, so the payment for each project is a donation to Kollektiv. It's a double win - your company's donation pays for a quality product and simultaneously supports the next generation of developers. \r\n\r\nWe are currently accepting new project ideas. Get in touch.\r\n\r\n### Mentors and Sponsors\r\n#### Mentors\r\nDuana Saskia Stanley, Senior Developer, SoundCloud\r\nJosep T. Bach, \r\nOliver Hookins\r\nSergio Gil PÃ©rez de la Manga\r\n\r\n#### Sponsors\r\nSoundCloud\r\n\r\n### Blog\r\n[link to blog page]\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nDo you have something you've always wanted to build? \r\n\r\nDo you want to support the next generation of developers? \r\n\r\nWe want to connect you with learners eager to work on real projects. Contact us to setup an initial meeting to discuss your project idea. We will then work with your team and our mentors to decide on the scope, mentors and sponsorship amount for the project. \r\n\r\nGet in touch.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
