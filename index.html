<a name="welcome-to-kollektiv" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-kollektiv"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Kollektiv</h3>

<p>We are a collective of female developers in Berlin who build Ruby on Rails web applications.</p>

<p>Our vision is that every person who dreams of becoming a developer - regardless of education level, identit(ies) or background - should have a financially stable opportunity to pursue that dream. By connecting learners with real projects, Kollektiv provides the infrastructure to support the next generation of developers.</p>

<a name="our-story" class="anchor" href="#our-story"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Story</h3>

<p>We are Nina and Laura. Nina started her own tech support company in Slovenia and Laura worked as a program manager with queer and transgender youth in the US. We both had the feeling that programming was too macho for us - that perhaps it was just for men - until we found <a href="http://www.railsgirls.org">Rails Girls</a>. We both completed the <a href="http://www.railsgirlssummerofcode.org">2013 Rails Girls Summer of Code</a>, where we spent 3 months learning Ruby on Rails full-time. Five months ago we didn't know a thing about GitHub and today we're ready to work on real client projects. </p>

<p>There are plenty of people just like us who are making a switch to programming mid-career. We call them the "next generation of developers". The vision of Kollektiv is to support this generation by working with mentors on real projects for real money.</p>

<a name="what-we-do" class="anchor" href="#what-we-do"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What We Do</h3>

<p>We build Ruby on Rails web applications. Do you have something you've always wanted to build? Need an online store or an internal solution for your office? We can build it.</p>

<p>We use an agile approach to software development and value simple solutions. To stay agile, we work directly with your team to make sure that we build an MVP that people use. Weekly updates help us stay in touch and GitHub helps us track our progress. </p>

<p>Once we agree on a project scope, we work alongside professional mentors in the field to learn the skills necessary to deliver a great product. Mentors take the burden off of your company to supply a quality learning experience and we share learning infrastructure with the wider Rails community.</p>

<p>Payment is structured as a sponsorship, so the payment for each project is a donation to Kollektiv. It's a double win - your company's donation pays for a quality product and simultaneously supports the next generation of developers. </p>

<p>We are currently accepting new project ideas. Get in touch.</p>
